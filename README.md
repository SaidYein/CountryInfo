# CountryInfo App

API Project

## Description

<p>In this app, we use API to get and render basic data about a country and its neighbors by entering a value to input field on the screes</p>

### MUST HAVES

* The app should be a single page and use API to get data
* A user can enter a country name in to the input field to get the data
* A user can trigger search by either pressing 'Enter' or clicking the button on the screen
* A user can see countries listed in different cards on screen
* The country data card should include the followings: Flag, population (in millions), capital and currency
* A user can differ the country serached and its neighbors by the card sizes

### NICE-TO-HAVES

* A user can click on any of the listed countries (either the neighbors or the country itself) and trigger another search
* Changing background image on every search
